# SIC

First, you can know about SIC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Instructional_Computer"> Here </a><br></br>
About SIC and SIC/XE Architecture & System Specification <a href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~stremler/2003_CS530/SicArchitecture.html"> Here </a><br></br>

This my SIC C++ program, I had implemented 2 years ago with no intent to share it, so there is no good documentation or comments.
